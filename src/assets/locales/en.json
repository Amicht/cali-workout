When one circuit is completed, one begins the first exercise again for the next circuit. Traditionally, the time between exercises in circuit training is short and often with rapid movement to the next exercise.\" (wikipedia)"

They are intended to increase strength, fitness, and flexibility, through movements such as pulling, pushing, bending, jumping, or swinging, using one's body weight for resistance in pull-ups, push-ups, squats, etc. Calisthenics can provide the benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility, and coordination."

And depending on your goals, you can change the sets and reps to focus more on strength, muscle growth or endurance. Dan John sums it up nicely: “Almost universally, getting stronger in the fundamental human movements is going to help with your goals, whether they be fat loss, hypertrophy or improved sports performance.”"
